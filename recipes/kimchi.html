        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Kimchi comes in almost as many forms as there are vegetables because nearly any vegetable can be fermented. They range from super mild smell to mega funky and mellow to melt-your-face-off spicy and there is one for every possible point in between.
            This Korean classic is made by fermenting cabbage and carrots in a tangy, spicy sauce - try this speedy version for a tasty side dish.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Prepare the kimchi:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut the cabbage.</strong> Cut the cabbage lengthwise through the stem into quarters. Cut the cores from each piece. Cut each quarter crosswise into 2-inch-wide strips.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Salt the cabbage.</strong> Place the cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. </li>
            <li><strong>Rinse and drain the cabbage.</strong> Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3 times. </li>
            <li><strong>Make the spice paste.</strong> Rinse and dry the bowl you used for salting. Add the garlic, ginger, sugar, and fish sauce, shrimp paste, or water and stir into a smooth paste. Stir in the gochugaru, using 1 tablespoon for mild and up to 5 tablespoons for spicy (I like about 3 1/2 tablespoons); set aside until the cabbage is ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine the vegetables and spice paste.</strong> Gently squeeze any remaining water from the cabbage and add it to the spice paste. Add the radish and scallions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix thoroughly.</strong> Using your hands, gently work the paste into the vegetables until they are thoroughly coated. The gloves are optional here but highly recommended to protect your hands from stings, stains, and smells!</li>
            <li><strong>Pack the kimchi into the jar.</strong> Pack the kimchi into a 1-quart jar. </li>
            
        </ol>
